## How It's Made:

This project uses the deck of cards API. The player places a bet each turn on the outcome of a hand. The information recieved from the API is filtered and displayed. Local storage is used to preserve the state of the deck and bank balance

## Optimizations

The project can be optimized by adding media queries to target specific resolutions and media.

## Lessons Learned:

The developer tools allowed me to view the object returned from the API. I was able to log each request and filter out the properties relevant for the project.
